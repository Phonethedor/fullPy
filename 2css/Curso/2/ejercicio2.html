                <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                    Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. 
                    It is a small and lightwight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers 
                    to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a 
                    host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of 
                    these envioronments to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="" class="dest">Variable Declaration</a> 
                        JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine 
                        a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. 
                        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. 
                        <span class="destaca">var x;</span></li>
                    <li><a href="" class="dest">Variable Assignment</a> 
                        Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, 
                        giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. 
                        <span class="destaca">var x = 10;</span></li>
                    <li><a href="" class="dest">Data Types</a> 
                    Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. 
                        there are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="destaca">true</span> or 
                        <span class="destaca"> false;</span> null - <span class="destaca">null</span> aka nothing; Number - 
                        <span class="destaca">42</span> or <span class="destaca">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="destaca">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                        Array - <span class="destaca">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - 
                        <span class="destaca">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                    <li><a href="" class="dest">Conditionals</a> 
                        When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different
                        code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. there
                        are the following conditional statements : <span class="destaca">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
                        <span class="destaca">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; 
                        <span class="destaca">else</span>
                        we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <li><a href="" class="dest">Loops</a> 
                        There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: 
                        they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four 
                        times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li><a href="" class="dest">Function</a> 
                        Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. think of it as a list of
                        instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,
                        first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly 
                        there are a ton more talbes to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
